# The objective of this assignment is to use Monte Carlo simulation to assess
# the risks and rewards associated with various expansion strategies for the cafÂ´e
# chain. You will evaluate the performance of different strategies and determine
# the best one based on net present value (NPV), payback period, and return on
# investment (ROI).

# The following probability distributions will be used to model the uncertainty in
# the data:
# 1. Initial investment: Triangular distribution with min, max, and most likely
# values provided for each location
# 2. Monthly operating costs: Normal distribution with mean and standard
# deviation provided for each location
# 3. Monthly foot traffic: Poisson distribution with mean provided for each
# location
# 4. Average spend per customer: Lognormal distribution with mean and standard deviation provided for each location
